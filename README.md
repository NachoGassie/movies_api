Welcome to my Movies Api in Express. You'll see there are two branches
- <master> which is deployed on render and free to try on this link https://movies-api-idv6.onrender.com/
- <local> to try this one you'll have to import the database db_peliculas on your local machine that can be found on the "mySqlDB".
